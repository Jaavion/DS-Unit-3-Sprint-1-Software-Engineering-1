- What, in your opinion, is an important part of code reviews? That is, what is
  something you pay attention to when you review code, and that you appreciate
  when others do the same for your code?
  Code Reviewing is essential. It helps the programmer accept criticism. I think code review also allows the programmer to see different styles of coding in a way thats useful.
- We have an awful lot of computers here, and it gets pretty confusing with
  slightly different things running on all of them. How could containers help us
  improve this situation? i think running on containers would be useful because you have the ability to delte and start over again at will. you aren't constrained to that one computer it's you're also able to send the files and work on them locally
